Analysis

Our initial hypothesis stated that as we move closer to the equator the temperature gets higher.  It appears that our initial hypothesis was proven correct, but only figuratively. The data display that as we move closer to latitude 0 the temperature starts to cool down as you move beyond latitude 0 to -10. Our hypothesis is true in reference to starting at a lat of 80 and moving closer to the equator. Yes, the temperature gets warmer (at lat 20) and then cools as you approach lat 0.

The data shows no true trend in relation to latitude and humidity. As you move past lat 0 humidity still exist and only becomes a little sparser. 

The most interesting data was displayed when we compared Latitude to Cloudiness. Based on the analysis, cloudiness is stable across all ranges of latitude. It will be interesting to add a time series factor (dates, seasons, etc.) to further investigate the trend.
